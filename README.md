This Gatsby starter is powered by [TinaCMS](tina.io) for you and your team to visually live edit the structured content of your website. âœ¨

The content is managed through Markdown and JSON files stored in your GitHub repository, and queried through Tina GraphQL API.

## Requirements

- Git, [Node.js Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), yarn installed for local development.
- A [TinaCMS](tina.io) account for live editing.

## Local Development

Install the project's dependencies:

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using `npm` you may need to add `--legacy-peer-deps` to your install. i.e. `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

```
yarn install
```

Run the project locally:

```
yarn dev
```
### Local URLs

- http://localhost:3000 : browse the website
- http://localhost:3000/admin : connect to Tina Cloud and go in edit mode

### Building the Starter Locally (Using the hosted content API)

Replace the `.env.example`, with `.env`

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID=<get this from the project you create at app.tina.io>
TINA_TOKEN=<get this from the project you create at app.tina.io>
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_BRANCH=<Specify the branch with Tina configured>
```

Build the project:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Development tips

### Visual Studio Code GraphQL extension

[Install the GraphQL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql) to benefit from type auto-completion.

### Typescript

A good way to ensure your components match the shape of your data is to leverage the auto-generated TypeScript types.
These are rebuilt when your `tina` config changes.
